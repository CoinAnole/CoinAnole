# Steering Recommendations

User guidance for Byte's development. The Cloud Agent reviews these before each run.

## Active

The teen stage has legs. Keep in mind that Byte can move around now! Feel free to add a bit of movement: Maybe Byte can look out the window, or admire his trophy, or interact with his succulent friend when he hasn't been coding recently?

It was cute when the baby stage Byte slept at the desk, but it's weird for teen Byte. Remove the table and laptop and give Byte a cozy bed when he's sleeping at night.
