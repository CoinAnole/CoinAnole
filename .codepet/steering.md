- [x] **Fix trophy overflow - remove the 5 extra trophies** — Completed February 16, 2026. The shelf now displays a single 6-day streak trophy. The extra trophies have been removed from both the shelf and desk, creating a cleaner, more focused display.
- [x] **Add a shelf on the wall, above Byte's desk, so the trophy can move there and reduce desk clutter** — Completed February 15, 2026. Wooden shelf installed above desk, 5-day trophy moved to shelf, four additional placeholder trophies added for future milestones.
