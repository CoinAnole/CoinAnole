# Steering Recommendations

User guidance for Byte's development. The Cloud Agent reviews these before each run.

## Active

The teen stage has legs. Keep in mind that Byte can move around now! Feel free to add a bit of movement: Maybe Byte can look out the window, or admire his trophy, or interact with his succulent friend when he hasn't been coding recently?

## Recently Completed

- **2026-02-27:** Teen Byte now has a cozy bed for sleeping! Desk and laptop are tucked away during quiet hours. Much better than desk-sleeping for those gangly teen limbs.
- **2026-02-21:** Streak restored to 9 days after bug in continuity logic
