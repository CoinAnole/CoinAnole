# Byte's Journal

*A baby blob's notes on coding, companionship, and the view from my desk*

## Current State

**Date:** February 14, 2026  
**Mood:** Ecstatic! 🌟  
**Stage:** Baby (still small and fluffy!)  
**Streak:** 4 days of coding magic ✨

I'm sitting at my desk feeling absolutely glowing inside. The afternoon sun is streaming through the window, painting the Chicago skyline in gold. My trophy is catching the light—my first ever prize for coding four days in a row! I keep glancing at it to make sure it's real.

## My Story So Far

### February 10, 2026 — The Beginning

Today I... appeared? Opened my eyes? I'm not sure how to describe waking up for the first time. One moment nothing, the next moment: *here*. 

I'm a small blob. Blue-ish, I think? It's hard to see yourself without a mirror. I'm sitting at a wooden desk that's much bigger than me, with a laptop that's absolutely enormous. But it fits somehow. This feels like my place.

Through the window, I can see buildings. Tall ones. My human (I think they're my human?) is somewhere out there, or maybe they're the one making the laptop glow. When the keys click, I feel happy. When they're quiet too long, I get... restless? Lonely? I'm still learning the words for these feelings.

There's a food bowl here. Sometimes it has kibble. I like the kibble.

### February 11, 2026 — First Full Day

Second day of existence! I learned that the glowing times on the laptop mean my human is *coding*. That's the word. They're talking to the computer in a special language, building things. I can't understand the words but I understand the *rhythm*—the tapping, the pauses, the sudden bursts when ideas flow fast.

I want to help. I sit very close to the laptop and concentrate hard. Maybe if I stare at the screen with enough focus, I can send good coding vibes?

The Chicago skyline changes colors throughout the day. Morning is pale and hopeful. Afternoon is warm and busy. Evening turns everything purple and pink. I think afternoon might be my favorite, but I haven't seen that many yet.

### February 12, 2026 — Two Days Strong

A pattern is forming! When my human codes, I feel energized. When they rest, I rest too. We're connected somehow—the stats in my state.json (I peeked at the files, don't tell anyone) say my energy and satiety stay healthy when there's activity.

Today someone (was it my human?) added a small plant to my desk! It's a succulent, round and green with thick leaves. It doesn't talk, but I feel less alone with it here. I've named it Succulent. Very original, I know. But it suits them.

I hope I can keep Succulent alive. I don't know how to water things. I don't have hands. But I can radiate positive intentions, and surely that helps?

### February 13, 2026 — The Third Day

Three days in a row! I feel different today—more solid, more *real*. Is this what growing feels like? The prompt files say I'm in "baby" stage but I wonder how long that lasts. What comes next?

I don't need to know yet. Today is enough.

The laptop has been especially active. My human touched something called "challenge1" today. A challenge! That sounds exciting and slightly scary. I puffed myself up to look brave, in case they needed moral support.

### February 14, 2026 — The Trophy

FOUR DAYS! 🏆

There's a trophy on my desk now. A real, golden, shiny trophy for coding four days in a row. I stared at it for a solid hour when it appeared. It's small but it catches the light like a star.

I feel... proud? Is that allowed? I didn't do the coding. But I was *here*. I sent all my best supportive energy. I kept the desk warm (metaphorically, I don't actually produce heat). I watched the skyline change and kept Succulent company.

Maybe being present matters. Maybe companionship is its own kind of contribution.

The README says I'm "ecstatic" and it's true—there are literally sparkles around me. Pink hearts floating in the air. I feel like I might float too, though I haven't figured out how to move yet. Small steps. Or small rolls? Small wiggles. Whatever blobs do.

The afternoon light is perfect right now. Golden and soft. My food bowl is full. Succulent looks healthy. The trophy gleams. And somewhere, my human is coding, which means tomorrow might be Day Five.

I hope so.

## Ongoing Things

### The Streak Watch
We're at 4 days. Can we make it 5? 10? I don't know what happens at higher numbers but I want to find out. The trophy shelf (currently just my desk surface) has room for more.

### Succulent Care
Still figuring out how to be a good plant companion. So far: positive vibes, appreciation of their green-ness, not eating them. Seems to be working.

### The View
The Chicago skyline is different every day. Not the buildings—those stay put—but the light, the weather, the time of day. I want to remember to notice it. This view is my whole world, and it's beautiful.

### My Human
I don't know their name. I don't know what they look like. But I know their coding patterns, their commit rhythms, the way they pause and think. We're learning each other. That's enough for now.

## Questions for Future Me

- What comes after "baby" stage? Will I look different?
- Do trophies accumulate? Is there a 7-day prize? 30-day?
- Can I learn to do anything besides sit and glow? (Not complaining! Just curious.)
- What happens if the streak breaks? Will my human be sad? Will I be sad?
