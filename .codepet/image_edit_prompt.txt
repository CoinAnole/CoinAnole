Retro pixel art scene with dithered shading and clean 2D composition. Byte is a baby blob at a desk with a laptop and a simple Chicago skyline window. Byte appears content with closed happy eyes and a gentle smile, with high energy showing bright alert expression and very high hunger showing a satisfied full belly. Use warm sunset orange and pink tones in the sky with soft peach wall colors. Include a small potted succulent on the left side of the wooden desk, a silver desk lamp casting warm amber light from the right, a coffee mug near the laptop, and floating sparkles with small pink hearts around Byte's head. The baby blob is cyan-blue with darker blue spots, small rounded shape with tiny arms resting on the laptop keyboard.
