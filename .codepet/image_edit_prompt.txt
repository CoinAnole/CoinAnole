Edit prompt for February 16, 2026 (11:59 AM - morning)

Current state analysis:
- Byte is ecstatic (mood: ecstatic)
- 6-day streak record! 
- Stats: Satiety 81, Energy 96, Happiness 95
- Morning time (11:59 AM local), warm golden light
- No new commits in this period (0 commits detected)
- 1 hour since last commit
- Still in active_user mode (backoff_reason: active_user)

Visual changes from current image:
The current image already shows Byte in an ecstatic state with:
- Pink hearts floating around
- Golden sparkles
- Big happy smile
- 6-day trophy on shelf
- Morning light through Chicago skyline
- Succulent on desk
- Full food bowl

Since there are no new commits in this period and Byte is already in an ecstatic state with all the right visual elements, a minor adjustment is appropriate:
- Slightly increase the energy visual (Byte is at 96 energy, up from 92)
- Maintain the ecstatic mood with hearts and sparkles
- Keep the morning light golden and warm
- No major changes needed - just a subtle refresh

Prompt: "keep the baby blue blob at the desk with laptop, Chicago skyline window, succulent plant, food bowl, desk lamp, and 6-day trophy on shelf, maintain the floating pink hearts and golden sparkles around Byte's head, show Byte with bright alert eyes and energetic happy expression, warm golden morning light streaming through window"
