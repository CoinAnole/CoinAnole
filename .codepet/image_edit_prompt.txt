Retro pixel art scene with dithered shading and clean 2D composition. Byte is a baby blob at a desk with a laptop and a simple Chicago skyline window. Byte appears ecstatic with sparkles and floating pink hearts around the head, with bright alert eyes and a joyful expression. The energy is high and vibrant. Use a warm golden morning palette with bright cheerful tones. The morning light streams through the window showing the Chicago skyline in soft daylight colors. Include a wooden shelf above the desk with a SINGLE gold trophy on it, a succulent plant on the left side of the desk, a desk lamp, and a food bowl under the desk. Remove the extra trophies from the shelf and the trophy from the desk - only one trophy should be visible on the shelf.
