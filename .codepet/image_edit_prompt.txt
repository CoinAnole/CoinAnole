Retro pixel art scene with dithered shading and clean 2D composition. Byte is a baby blob at a desk with a laptop and a simple Chicago skyline window. Byte appears ecstatic with big sparkling eyes, wide happy smile, and pink blush on cheeks. Byte has vibrant energy with bright saturated colors and alert expression. Byte looks well-fed with healthy plump appearance. Use warm golden morning palette with soft yellows, oranges, and bright blues. Include a wooden trophy shelf mounted on the wall above the desk with a single golden trophy displaying the number 6. Include a small green succulent in a terracotta pot on the left side of the desk, a desk lamp with warm light, a food bowl with kibble under the desk, and floating pink hearts and golden sparkles around Byte's head celebrating the 6-day streak record.
