Prompt:
Retro pixel art scene with dithered shading and clean 2D composition. Byte is a baby blob at a desk with a laptop and a simple Chicago skyline window. Byte appears ecstatic and sleeping peacefully, with closed eyes, rosy cheeks, and little Z's floating above the head. The energy is full and vibrant. The satiety is well-fed and content. Use a warm purple-pink nighttime palette with deep violet walls, soft pink highlights from the window, and golden sparkles from a desk lamp. Include a small succulent plant in a terracotta pot on the left side of the desk, a golden trophy on the right side, a food bowl with kibble, and floating pink hearts and golden sparkles throughout the scene. The desk lamp casts a warm protective glow over the sleeping blob. The Chicago skyline outside shows twinkling city lights against a deep purple-pink night sky.
