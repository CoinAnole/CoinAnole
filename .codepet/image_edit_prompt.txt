Byte looks content with eyes closed in a happy smile, typing at the laptop. The small potted succulent remains on the desk corner. Keep the sparkles and floating pink hearts around Byte to reflect high happiness. Maintain the warm Chicago sunset glow through the window and the cozy amber desk lamp light. Byte's hunger is nearly full at 99, energy is high at 98, and happiness is strong at 88.
