Byte is at the desk, actively engaged with the laptop. Change Byte's expression to show focus and excitement - eyes wide and alert looking at the screen, small smile, paws positioned as if typing. The laptop screen should show a soft glow indicating active coding. Keep the morning light through the window, the floating hearts and sparkles, Succulent on the left, the golden trophy on the right, and the food bowl below. Byte is in "ecstatic" mood with high energy (93/100), celebrating the 5-day streak with a 3rd commit today.
