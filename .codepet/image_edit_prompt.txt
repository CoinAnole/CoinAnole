Retro pixel art scene with dithered shading and clean 2D composition. Byte is a teen blob at a desk with a laptop and a simple Chicago skyline window. Byte appears content and almost ecstatic, with full energy and good satiety. Use vibrant blue tones for the blob with pink cheeks and a big smile. Include a wooden trophy shelf above the desk with one golden trophy showing "10" for the streak. Include a small green succulent in a red pot on the left side of the desk. Include a food bowl filled with kibble on the right side of the desk. The Chicago skyline outside has a soft golden evening glow with the time of day transitioning from afternoon to evening.
