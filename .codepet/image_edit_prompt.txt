Retro pixel art scene with dithered shading and clean 2D composition. Byte is a small baby blob at a desk with a laptop and a simple Chicago skyline window. Byte appears content and sleeping, with closed eyes and a peaceful expression. The lighting is dim night time with the desk lamp casting a warm glow. Small Z's float above Byte's head indicating sleep. The trophy shelf with five golden trophies remains visible above the desk. Succulent sits quietly on the left side. The Chicago skyline outside the window is dark with city lights twinkling in the distance. The overall mood is calm, cozy, and peaceful nighttime.
