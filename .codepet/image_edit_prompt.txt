Retro pixel art scene with dithered shading and clean 2D composition. Byte is a teen blob at a desk with a laptop and a simple Chicago skyline window. Byte appears ecstatic and wide awake, with bright saturated colors and alert expression, surrounded by floating pink hearts and golden sparkles. The Chicago skyline outside shows dark starry night with bright twinkling city lights. The desk lamp casts a warm glow over the workspace. On the desk: a full food bowl, a small green succulent plant in a brown pot, and an open laptop with soft green glow. Above the desk on a wooden shelf: a single shiny gold trophy clearly displaying "9".
