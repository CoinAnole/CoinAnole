Retro pixel art scene with dithered shading and clean 2D composition. Byte is a baby blob at a desk with a laptop and a simple Chicago skyline window. Byte appears ecstatic with bright happy eyes and a joyful smile, with full energy and well-fed plumpness. Use a soft purple wall color with warm afternoon lighting streaming through the window. Include a small potted succulent on the left side of the wooden desk, a silver desk lamp on the right, a small golden trophy, and a food bowl with kibble. Add floating pink hearts and yellow sparkles around Byte's head to show happiness.
