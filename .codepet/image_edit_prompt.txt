Byte is ecstatic with a 4-day coding streak! Change the expression from tired/hungry to joyful and excited. Replace the pie thought bubble with sparkles and small floating hearts. Add a celebration feel - maybe a small trophy or star on the desk. The food bowl can now have some food in it. Brighten the overall lighting to reflect the happy mood. Keep the pixel art style, desk, laptop, Chicago skyline window, and desk lamp.
