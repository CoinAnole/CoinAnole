Byte is now sleeping. Change the baby blob to have closed eyes, peaceful expression, and add floating Z's above the head. Dim the lighting slightly to reflect late night. Keep the Chicago skyline in the window, the succulent on the left, the trophy on the right, and the food bowl. The laptop screen can be dark or in sleep mode. Maintain the pixel art style with dithered shading.
