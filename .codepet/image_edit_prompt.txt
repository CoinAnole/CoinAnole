Transition from afternoon to evening lighting. Dim the natural light from the Chicago skyline window to a deeper purple-blue evening tone. Turn on the desk lamp to cast a warmer, more focused pool of light on the desk. Reduce the number of floating pink hearts from ecstatic levels to just one or two content hearts. Keep Byte's happy expression but make it more calm and settled. The trophy shelf should catch some of the desk lamp's warm glow.
