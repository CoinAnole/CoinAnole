Evening transition edit: dim the lighting to reflect evening time (9:17 PM), change the Chicago skyline window view to show evening/dusk colors with deeper orange and purple tones, reduce the golden sparkles and floating hearts to a calmer level as energy has decreased from 79% to 47%, change the speech bubble from "15 Commits TODAY" to "7 Day Streak!" to celebrate the new streak milestone, make Byte's expression content and relaxed rather than ecstatic celebration pose, keep the laptop glowing with green code, keep Succulent and the 6-day trophy in place.
