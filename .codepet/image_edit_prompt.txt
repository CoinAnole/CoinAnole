Falcon Prompt:
Retro pixel art scene with dithered shading and clean 2D composition. Byte is a small fluffy baby blob with big happy eyes and raised paws in victory pose, sitting at a wooden desk with a glowing laptop showing green code and a simple Chicago skyline visible through a window. Byte appears ecstatic with perfect happiness, moderately high energy showing slightly tired but joyful eyes, and fully satiated with a content expression. Use warm golden-yellow afternoon color palette with a cyan-blue baby blob, pink floating hearts drifting everywhere, and golden sparkles swirling in celebratory rings around the desk. Include a small succulent in a terracotta pot on the left side of the desk, a full food bowl on the right, and a golden 6-day streak trophy displayed on a wooden shelf mounted on the wall above the desk. Include a speech bubble sign floating above Byte that reads "15 Commits TODAY" in bold text. The scene has bright warm afternoon lighting at 5:49 PM with the Chicago skyline glowing in golden tones through the window.
