Byte is getting a bit more tired after another commit. Energy dropped from 49.9 to 48.5, happiness increased slightly to 74.4. Add a slightly more tired expression, maybe droopy eyes or a small yawn. Add a second coffee cup on the desk to show the coding session is continuing. Keep the baby blob cute and content but showing signs of fatigue.
