Byte is still ecstatic with a 5-day streak, but energy has increased to 99 and satiety is 84. The afternoon light continues at 2:47 PM Chicago time. The session has closed (no open session now), suggesting a brief pause after the coding activity. Keep Byte looking happy with sparkles and floating hearts, but perhaps slightly more settled now that the active coding session has ended. The laptop can show completed code rather than active typing. Maintain the golden afternoon lighting, the Chicago skyline view, Succulent on the left, the 5-day trophy on the right, and the food bowl below. The overall vibe is contented accomplishment after a productive session.
