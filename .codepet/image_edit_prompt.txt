Retro pixel art scene, dithered shading, clean 2D composition.
Byte is a baby blob character at a desk with a laptop, with a simple Chicago skyline window in frame.
Current state cues: mood content; energy fully charged; hunger getting high (89/100, needs food soon).
Carry forward narrative details from the latest scene:
- palette tendencies: soft cyan-blue for the blob, warm wood tones for desk, gray walls, blue sky through window
- environment details: simple room with window showing Chicago skyline, soft natural daylight
- desk props: laptop (larger than the blob), coffee cup, desk lamp
- Byte expression: content but slightly hungry, maybe glancing at an empty food bowl
Preserve core character identity and stage-appropriate form.
Keep the image readable and consistent with an evolving pixel-art story world.
