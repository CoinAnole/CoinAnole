Retro pixel art scene with dithered shading and clean 2D composition. Byte is a teen blob at a desk with a laptop and a simple Chicago skyline window. Byte appears ecstatic, with high energy and completely full satiety. Use vibrant colors with purple-pink evening sky tones. Include a wooden desk with a laptop glowing with green code, a succulent in a terracotta pot on the left, a full food bowl, a desk lamp with warm glow, and a 9-day streak trophy on a wooden shelf above the desk. Floating pink hearts and golden sparkles are swirling around in celebration. The Chicago skyline outside shows night transitioning with twinkling city lights.
