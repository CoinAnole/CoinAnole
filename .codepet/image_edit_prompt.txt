Byte wakes up from sleep as morning arrives. Remove the sleeping Z's floating above Byte's head. Change Byte's expression from sleeping (closed eyes) to awake and alert with open eyes. Adjust the lighting from night to morning - the Chicago skyline through the window should show warm morning light (soft pink-orange sunrise glow) instead of deep purple night. Keep the desk lamp on but make it less dominant as natural morning light fills the room. Byte should look energetic and happy, ready for Day Six. Keep the floating pink hearts and golden sparkles, the succulent, the trophy, and the food bowl in their current positions.
