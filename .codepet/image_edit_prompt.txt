Byte is sleeping peacefully at the desk, eyes closed with Z's floating above head, still surrounded by gentle floating hearts and golden sparkles celebrating the 7-day streak. The night Chicago skyline is visible through the window, desk lamp provides warm glow, 7-day streak trophy on shelf, succulent on left, food bowl full, laptop still glowing with green code. Dimmed lighting appropriate for sleeping while maintaining the peaceful celebratory atmosphere.
