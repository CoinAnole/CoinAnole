Byte wakes up from sleep, eyes now open and alert. Remove the Z's floating above head. Change the lighting from night to early morning - the Chicago skyline outside the window should show dawn colors (soft pink, pale blue, gentle orange) instead of dark night with twinkling lights. The desk lamp can remain on but the overall ambiance should be brighter, more hopeful morning light. Byte looks content and ready for a new day. Keep the trophy shelf with 5 trophies, Succulent on the left, food bowl under desk, and laptop in front.
