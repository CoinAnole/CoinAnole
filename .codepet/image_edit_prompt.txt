Retro pixel art scene with dithered shading and clean 2D composition. Byte is a baby blob at a desk with a laptop and a simple Chicago skyline window. Byte appears content with a gentle smile and bright eyes, with high energy shown through alert posture and vibrant cyan coloring, and well-fed appearance with a full food bowl nearby. Use a warm sunset palette with soft orange and pink tones in the sky visible through the window, cyan and teal for Byte's body, warm brown for the wooden desk, and silver-gray for the laptop. Include a desk lamp casting warm light on the workspace and a coffee mug on the desk. Include sparkles floating near Byte's head to show happiness, a small pet food bowl on the left side of the desk, and a desk lamp on the right side.
