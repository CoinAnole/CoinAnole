    "stage_identity": {
      "status": "pass",
      "evidence": "Byte displays teen stage characteristics: gangly elongated limbs, larger form than baby stage, big expressive eyes, and slightly awkward teen proportions. The silhouette matches the canonical teen anchor reference used in multi-image edit."
    },
    "pixel_style": {
      "status": "pass",
      "evidence": "Clean 2D pixel art style maintained with dithered shading and readable silhouette. The multi-image edit with stage anchor preserved the pixel art aesthetic. No photorealistic or painterly artifacts detected."
    },
    "requested_changes_visible": {
      "status": "pass",
      "evidence": "Mid-afternoon lighting progression visible with brighter, warmer light than previous early afternoon scene. Byte's posture shows pronounced restlessness with head turned more intently toward the Chicago window. Subtle hunger awareness visible with hand positioned near food bowl, reflecting 4+ hour wait and 56% satiety."
    },
    "artifact_free": {
      "status": "pass",
      "evidence": "No garbled text, floating glyphs, or malformed anatomy detected. Clean render with distinct object boundaries. Byte's teen form is coherent with proper proportions. No smeared objects or duplicated parts."
    },
    "prop_layout_integrity": {
      "status": "pass",
      "evidence": "Trophy shelf: exactly 1 golden 10-day trophy positioned on left side, exactly 1 green plant on right side, clear spacing between them with no overlap. Desk: 1 wooden desk center stage with 1 oversized silver laptop open. Food bowl: 1 bowl on floor to right of desk with clear positioning. All single-instance props maintained correctly with proper spacing."
    },
    "anchors_present": {
      "status": "pass",
      "evidence": "All three required anchors visible: wooden desk with medium-tone finish center stage, oversized silver laptop open on desk, Chicago skyline visible through window showing mid-afternoon light. Room structure intact with proper spatial relationships."
    },
    "temporal_mood_match": {
      "status": "pass",
      "evidence": "Mid-afternoon time (2:45 PM Chicago) correctly reflected with bright warm afternoon lighting. Awake state confirmed with alert posture, open eyes, no Z symbols. Ecstatic mood visible in energetic posture despite waiting. The 4+ hour gap since commits reflected in anticipatory restlessness while maintaining high happiness."
    },
    "reground_cleanup": {
      "status": "pass",
      "evidence": "Not applicable for normal mode edit. This is an incremental edit (attempt 1 of normal mode), not a re-ground operation. Edit count since reset is 3, below the threshold of 6."
