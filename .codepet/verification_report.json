    "stage_identity": {
      "status": "pass",
      "evidence": "Byte displays teen stage characteristics: gangly proportions, elongated awkward limbs, larger form than baby stage, big expressive eyes. Facial expression shows the energetic teen form with slight restlessness appropriate for the stage."
    },
    "pixel_style": {
      "status": "pass",
      "evidence": "Clean 2D pixel art style maintained with dithered shading, readable silhouette, and consistent color palette. No photorealistic or painterly artifacts detected. Style matches expected pixel art aesthetic from multi-image edit with stage anchor reference."
    },
    "requested_changes_visible": {
      "status": "pass",
      "evidence": "Afternoon lighting transition visible with warmer, brighter light than previous late morning scene. Byte's posture shows subtle restlessness with head turned toward window as specified in prompt. Ecstatic mood maintained with energetic posture. Trophy shelf with golden trophy and green plant present. Food bowl positioned on floor."
    },
    "artifact_free": {
      "status": "pass",
      "evidence": "No garbled text, floating glyphs, or malformed anatomy detected. No smeared objects or duplicated parts. Clean render with distinct object boundaries. Byte's form is coherent with proper teen proportions."
    },
    "prop_layout_integrity": {
      "status": "pass",
      "evidence": "Trophy shelf: exactly 1 golden 10-day trophy on left side, exactly 1 green plant on right side, clear spacing between them with no overlap. Desk: 1 wooden desk center stage with 1 oversized silver laptop. Food bowl: 1 bowl on floor to right of desk, clearly positioned with no intersection with other objects. All single-instance props maintained correctly."
    },
    "anchors_present": {
      "status": "pass",
      "evidence": "All three required anchors visible: wooden desk with medium-tone finish center stage, oversized silver laptop open on desk with screen glow, Chicago skyline visible through window in background showing afternoon light. Room structure intact."
    },
    "temporal_mood_match": {
      "status": "pass",
      "evidence": "Afternoon time (12:53 PM Chicago) correctly reflected with bright warm lighting stronger than morning. Awake state confirmed with alert posture, open eyes, no Z symbols. Ecstatic mood (happiness 99.8%) visible in energetic posture. Time-of-day transition morning_to_afternoon visible in lighting quality."
