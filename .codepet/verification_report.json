      "status": "pass",
      "evidence": "Byte displays teen stage characteristics: gangly proportions, awkward but energetic posture, larger form than baby stage. Silhouette matches expected teen morphology with elongated limbs and expressive facial features."
    },
    "pixel_style": {
      "status": "pass",
      "evidence": "Clean 2D pixel art style maintained with dithered shading, readable silhouette, and consistent color palette. No photorealistic or painterly artifacts detected."

    "requested_changes_visible": {
      "status": "pass",
      "evidence": "Ecstatic mood reflected in bright eye expression and alert posture. Morning golden-pink lighting visible through Chicago skyline window. Trophy shelf with golden trophy and green plant both present. Food bowl positioned on floor. All re-ground props successfully re-applied."
    },
    "artifact_free": {
      "status": "pass",
      "evidence": "No garbled text, floating glyphs, or malformed anatomy detected. No smeared objects or duplicated parts. Clean render with distinct object boundaries."

    "prop_layout_integrity": {
      "status": "pass",
      "evidence": "Trophy shelf: exactly 1 golden 10-day trophy on left side, exactly 1 green plant on right side, clear spacing between them with no overlap. Desk: 1 wooden desk center stage with 1 oversized silver laptop. Food bowl: 1 bowl on floor to right of desk. All single-instance props maintained as single instances."
    },
    "anchors_present": {
      "status": "pass",
      "evidence": "All three required anchors visible: wooden desk with medium-tone finish center stage, oversized silver laptop open on desk, Chicago skyline visible through window in background providing environmental context."
    },
    "temporal_mood_match": {
      "status": "pass",
      "evidence": "Morning time (10:47 AM Chicago) correctly reflected with warm golden-pink lighting. Awake state confirmed with alert posture, open eyes, no Z symbols. Ecstatic mood (happiness 100%) visible in bright expression and energetic stance."

    "reground_cleanup": {
      "status": "pass",
      "evidence": "Re-ground successfully corrected layout from previous live image: prop positions normalized with clear spacing, trophy and plant properly positioned on shelf without ambiguity, food bowl clearly placed on floor. Removed any accumulated drift from 6 previous incremental edits. Fresh canonical structure established from stage anchor with narrative props re-applied cleanly."
