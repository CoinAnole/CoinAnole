      "status": "pass",
      "evidence": "Teen-stage Byte with fuzzy blue texture, gangly awkward proportions, and lanky limbs preserved. Characteristic teen silhouette maintained with recognizable awkward-but-endearing posture."

    "pixel_style": {
      "status": "pass",
      "evidence": "Clean pixel art style with dithered shading maintained. No drift toward photorealism or painterly rendering. Readable silhouette preserved."

    "requested_changes_visible": {
      "status": "pass",
      "evidence": "Sleeping state change applied: closed eyes visible, light blue floating Z's present above Byte's head, peaceful sleeping pose with head resting on paws."
    },
    "artifact_free": {
      "status": "pass",
      "evidence": "No garbled text, floating glyphs, malformed anatomy, or smeared objects detected. Clean render with proper pixel art edges."

      "evidence": "Trophy shelf visible above desk with exactly one golden 10-day trophy on left side and one leafy green plant on right side. Food bowl on floor to right of desk. Single instances only, no duplicates. Clear spacing between props, no overlap."

      "status": "pass",
      "evidence": "Sleeping state (is_sleeping=true) correctly reflected in visuals: closed eyes, floating Z's, peaceful resting pose. Deep night lighting (1:15 AM Chicago) with dim purple-blue ambient glow from skyline matches temporal state."
