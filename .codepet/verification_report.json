    "requested_changes_visible": {
      "status": "pass",
      "evidence": "Primary change from sitting at desk to standing on floor and looking at trophy is clearly visible. Byte's pose shifted from seated to standing upright with body turned toward trophy shelf. Expression shows admiration/pride."
