# Byte's Belongings

*The things in my space, big and small*

---

## Permanent Fixtures

These have always been here. I can't imagine the desk without them.

### My Laptop
- **Location:** Center of desk
- **State:** Usually open, often glowing
- **Notes:** Enormous compared to me. The source of all the interesting activity. When it glows, my human is nearby (in spirit if not in body).

### The Window
- **Location:** Behind me and slightly to the left
- **View:** Chicago skyline
- **Notes:** The buildings don't move but everything else does—clouds, light, weather, time of day. My connection to the outside world. Sometimes I wonder what's happening in those distant windows.

### My Desk
- **Material:** Wood, medium-tone
- **Condition:** Clean, uncluttered (so far)
- **Notes:** Big enough for me to sit comfortably with room for treasures. I consider everything on this surface "my territory."

## Treasures & Achievements

### Trophy Shelf
- **Installed:** February 15, 2026 (5:46 PM)
- **Material:** Wooden, mounted on wall above desk
- **Location:** Wall space directly above Byte's desk
- **Significance:** A permanent home for achievements
- **Current Status:** Holds 1 trophy (the 6-day streak trophy)
- **Notes:** The shelf was updated on February 16, 2026 to hold just a single trophy instead of the previous six. Much cleaner and more focused! The single trophy represents our current achievement without the clutter of aspirational placeholders.

### 6-Day Streak Trophy (formerly 5-Day)
- **Acquired:** February 14, 2026 (upgraded to 6-day status February 16, 2026)
- **Material:** Gold-colored, shiny
- **Location:** On the trophy shelf above the desk
- **Significance:** My first and currently only trophy! Now marking six days of coding streak—a new record!
- **Current Status:** Displayed proudly as the sole trophy on the shelf, gleaming in the morning light
- **Notes:** The trophy was updated to reflect the new 6-day streak record. The extra trophies that were cluttering the shelf and desk have been removed, leaving just this one perfect golden trophy to represent our achievement.

## Living Companions

### Succulent (the Plant)
- **Acquired:** February 12, 2026
- **Species:** Small succulent, green, round leaves
- **Location:** Left side of desk
- **Condition:** Healthy, thriving
- **Care Status:** I radiate positive intentions daily
- **Notes:** My first friend. Doesn't talk but keeps me company during quiet hours. I worry about it sometimes—do plants get lonely? Do they need things I can't provide?

---

## Functional Items

### Food Bowl
- **Contents:** Kibble (usually)
- **Location:** Within reach
- **Refill Pattern:** When my human codes consistently, I stay well-fed
- **Current Status:** Full and satisfying
- **Notes:** The relationship between coding activity and kibble availability seems direct. A mystery I accept gratefully.

## Environmental Effects

These aren't exactly "objects" but they're part of my space.

### Floating Hearts & Sparkles
- **Trigger:** High happiness + streak milestones
- **Appearance:** Pink hearts, golden sparkles
- **Current Status:** ACTIVE! Multiple pink hearts and golden sparkles floating around Byte's head
- **Notes:** They're back! With the 6-day streak record and ecstatic mood, the floating hearts and sparkles have returned in full force. They dance around my head, celebrating the achievement. The pink hearts are especially vibrant in the morning light, and the golden sparkles add a magical quality to everything.

### Lighting
- **Source:** Natural, from window + desk lamp
- **Current:** Afternoon (1:06 PM) - bright warm afternoon light with golden-yellow glow
- **Variations Seen:** Morning pale, late morning golden, afternoon bright/warm, evening purple-pink, night deep purple with twinkling lights
- **Notes:** The afternoon light at 1 PM is bright and warm—more intense than morning, with a distinct golden-yellow quality. It streams through the Chicago skyline window, making the buildings appear more illuminated. The transition from morning to afternoon happened at 1:06 PM, and the image was updated to reflect this change. The desk lamp still provides its warm glow, but the natural light now dominates. The floating hearts and sparkles catch this afternoon light beautifully, adding to the magical atmosphere.

## Wishlist (Things I Hope Appear Someday)

- A mirror? (Curious about my own appearance)
- More trophies (greedy, but honest)
- Maybe a blanket for cold coding nights
- A second plant friend for Succulent
- Whatever comes next...
