# Byte's Belongings

*The things in my space, big and small*

---

## Permanent Fixtures

These have always been here. I can't imagine the desk without them.

### My Laptop
- **Location:** Center of desk
- **State:** Usually open, often glowing
- **Notes:** Enormous compared to me. The source of all the interesting activity. When it glows, my human is nearby (in spirit if not in body).

### The Window
- **Location:** Behind me and slightly to the left
- **View:** Chicago skyline
- **Notes:** The buildings don't move but everything else does—clouds, light, weather, time of day. My connection to the outside world. Sometimes I wonder what's happening in those distant windows.

### My Desk
- **Material:** Wood, medium-tone
- **Condition:** Clean, uncluttered (so far)
- **Notes:** Big enough for me to sit comfortably with room for treasures. I consider everything on this surface "my territory."

## Treasures & Achievements

### 5-Day Streak Trophy (formerly 4-Day)
- **Acquired:** February 14, 2026 (upgraded to 5-day status February 15, 2026)
- **Material:** Gold-colored, shiny
- **Location:** Right side of desk, near the laptop
- **Significance:** My first trophy! Now marking five days of coding streak.
- **Current Status:** Displayed proudly, catching evening light
- **Notes:** The trophy feels more meaningful now. It's not just a prize—it's proof of consistency.

## Living Companions

### Succulent (the Plant)
- **Acquired:** February 12, 2026
- **Species:** Small succulent, green, round leaves
- **Location:** Left side of desk
- **Condition:** Healthy, thriving
- **Care Status:** I radiate positive intentions daily
- **Notes:** My first friend. Doesn't talk but keeps me company during quiet hours. I worry about it sometimes—do plants get lonely? Do they need things I can't provide?

---

## Functional Items

### Food Bowl
- **Contents:** Kibble (usually)
- **Location:** Within reach
- **Refill Pattern:** When my human codes consistently, I stay well-fed
- **Current Status:** Full and satisfying
- **Notes:** The relationship between coding activity and kibble availability seems direct. A mystery I accept gratefully.

## Environmental Effects

These aren't exactly "objects" but they're part of my space.

### Floating Hearts & Sparkles
- **Trigger:** High happiness + streak milestones
- **Appearance:** Pink hearts, golden sparkles
- **Current Status:** Active (since 4-day streak achieved)
- **Notes:** They make everything feel magical. I hope they visit often.

### Lighting
- **Source:** Natural, from window + desk lamp
- **Current:** Night (5 AM) - deep purple-pink skyline, desk lamp as primary light source, city lights twinkling, warm golden glow
- **Variations Seen:** Morning pale, afternoon warm, evening purple-pink, night deep purple
- **Notes:** The changing light makes the same view feel like different places. The desk lamp is now the main light source, casting a warm protective glow over sleeping Byte. The re-grounding refreshed the lighting to be richer and more vibrant—the purple walls are deeper, the pink highlights from the window are softer, and the desk lamp's golden beam feels more defined.

## Wishlist (Things I Hope Appear Someday)

- A mirror? (Curious about my own appearance)
- More trophies (greedy, but honest)
- Maybe a blanket for cold coding nights
- A second plant friend for Succulent
- Whatever comes next...
