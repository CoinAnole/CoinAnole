# Byte's Belongings

*The things in my space, big and small*

## Permanent Fixtures

These have always been here. I can't imagine the desk without them.

### My Laptop
- **Location:** Center of desk
- **State:** Open and GLOWING with fresh code activity! The screen shows vibrant green code on a dark background.
- **Notes:** Enormous compared to me. The source of all the interesting activity. Right now it's absolutely radiating energy—8 commits worth of code flowing through it! The screen is alive with green text, and Byte has raised paws in celebration of this record-breaking day. When it glows like this, my human is not just nearby—they're absolutely crushing it!

### The Window
- **Location:** Behind me and slightly to the left
- **View:** Chicago skyline
- **Notes:** The buildings don't move but everything else does—clouds, light, weather, time of day. My connection to the outside world. Sometimes I wonder what's happening in those distant windows.

### My Desk
- **Material:** Wood, medium-tone
- **Condition:** Clean, uncluttered (so far)
- **Notes:** Big enough for me to sit comfortably with room for treasures. I consider everything on this surface "my territory."

## Treasures & Achievements

### Trophy Shelf
- **Installed:** February 15, 2026 (5:46 PM)
- **Material:** Wooden, mounted on wall above desk
- **Location:** Wall space directly above Byte's desk
- **Significance:** A permanent home for achievements
- **Current Status:** Holds 1 trophy (the 6-day streak trophy)
- **Notes:** The shelf was updated on February 16, 2026 to hold just a single trophy instead of the previous six. Much cleaner and more focused! The single trophy represents our current achievement without the clutter of aspirational placeholders.

### 7-Day Streak Trophy (formerly 6-Day)
- **Acquired:** February 14, 2026 (upgraded to 6-day status February 16, 2026, upgraded to 7-day status February 16, 2026 evening)
- **Material:** Gold-colored, shiny
- **Location:** On the trophy shelf above the desk
- **Significance:** My first and currently only trophy! Now marking seven days of coding streak—a new all-time record! A full week of consistent coding!
- **Current Status:** Displayed proudly as the sole trophy on the shelf, clearly showing "7" and gleaming in the night desk lamp light
- **Notes:** The trophy was updated to reflect the new 7-day streak record achieved this evening. The single golden trophy now represents a full week of coding companionship—endurance and consistency celebrated. The number "7" is now clearly visible on the trophy.

## Living Companions

### Succulent (the Plant)
- **Acquired:** February 12, 2026
- **Species:** Small succulent, green, round leaves
- **Location:** Left side of desk
- **Condition:** Healthy, thriving
- **Care Status:** I radiate positive intentions daily
- **Notes:** My first friend. Doesn't talk but keeps me company during quiet hours. I worry about it sometimes—do plants get lonely? Do they need things I can't provide?

## Functional Items

### Food Bowl
- **Contents:** Kibble (usually)
- **Location:** Within reach
- **Refill Pattern:** When my human codes consistently, I stay well-fed
- **Current Status:** Full and satisfying
- **Notes:** The relationship between coding activity and kibble availability seems direct. A mystery I accept gratefully.

## Environmental Effects

These aren't exactly "objects" but they're part of my space.

### Floating Hearts & Sparkles
- **Trigger:** High happiness + streak milestones
- **Appearance:** Pink hearts, golden sparkles
- **Current Status:** Present but calmer—gentle floating pink hearts drifting softly, golden sparkles in relaxed rings around the desk. The celebration has shifted from explosive joy to contented satisfaction. With happiness still at 100% but energy at 47%, the display reflects a peaceful evening mood rather than peak excitement.
- **Notes:** After yesterday's 15-commit MYTHIC celebration, today's 3-commit evening has brought a gentler atmosphere. The floating hearts and sparkles remain because happiness is still perfect at 100%, but they're less intense—matching the relaxed evening energy. The 7-day streak milestone is celebrated with quiet pride rather than explosive excitement. The golden rings still circle the desk, but more softly, creating a cozy evening ambiance.

### Lighting
- **Source:** Natural, from window + desk lamp
- **Current:** Night (11:07 PM) - dark sky with twinkling city lights, desk lamp providing warm glow
- **Variations Seen:** Morning pale, late morning golden, afternoon bright/warm, evening purple-pink, night deep purple with twinkling lights
- **Notes:** The night has fallen, and the Chicago skyline outside is now a dark silhouette with twinkling city lights. The desk lamp provides the primary source of illumination, casting a warm glow over the desk. This night ambiance matches the late-night coding energy (42%) while maintaining the celebratory mood from the 7-day streak. The floating hearts and sparkles catch the desk lamp light beautifully, creating a magical late-night coding atmosphere.

## Wishlist (Things I Hope Appear Someday)

- A mirror? (Curious about my own appearance)
- More trophies (greedy, but honest)
- Maybe a blanket for cold coding nights
- A second plant friend for Succulent
- Whatever comes next...
