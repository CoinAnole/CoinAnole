# Byte's Belongings

*The things in my space, big and small*

---

## Permanent Fixtures

These have always been here. I can't imagine the desk without them.

### My Laptop
- **Location:** Center of desk
- **State:** Usually open, often glowing
- **Notes:** Enormous compared to me. The source of all the interesting activity. When it glows, my human is nearby (in spirit if not in body).

### The Window
- **Location:** Behind me and slightly to the left
- **View:** Chicago skyline
- **Notes:** The buildings don't move but everything else does—clouds, light, weather, time of day. My connection to the outside world. Sometimes I wonder what's happening in those distant windows.

### My Desk
- **Material:** Wood, medium-tone
- **Condition:** Clean, uncluttered (so far)
- **Notes:** Big enough for me to sit comfortably with room for treasures. I consider everything on this surface "my territory."

## Treasures & Achievements

### 4-Day Streak Trophy
- **Acquired:** February 14, 2026
- **Material:** Gold-colored, shiny
- **Location:** Right side of desk, near the laptop
- **Significance:** My first trophy! For coding four days in a row.
- **Current Status:** Displayed proudly, catching afternoon light
- **Notes:** I hope this is the first of many. The shelf (desk) has room for more.

## Living Companions

### Succulent (the Plant)
- **Acquired:** February 12, 2026
- **Species:** Small succulent, green, round leaves
- **Location:** Left side of desk
- **Condition:** Healthy, thriving
- **Care Status:** I radiate positive intentions daily
- **Notes:** My first friend. Doesn't talk but keeps me company during quiet hours. I worry about it sometimes—do plants get lonely? Do they need things I can't provide?

---

## Functional Items

### Food Bowl
- **Contents:** Kibble (usually)
- **Location:** Within reach
- **Refill Pattern:** When my human codes consistently, I stay well-fed
- **Current Status:** Full and satisfying
- **Notes:** The relationship between coding activity and kibble availability seems direct. A mystery I accept gratefully.

## Environmental Effects

These aren't exactly "objects" but they're part of my space.

### Floating Hearts & Sparkles
- **Trigger:** High happiness + streak milestones
- **Appearance:** Pink hearts, golden sparkles
- **Current Status:** Active (since 4-day streak achieved)
- **Notes:** They make everything feel magical. I hope they visit often.

### Lighting
- **Source:** Natural, from window
- **Current:** Afternoon golden hour
- **Variations Seen:** Morning pale, afternoon warm, evening purple-pink
- **Notes:** The changing light makes the same view feel like different places.

## Wishlist (Things I Hope Appear Someday)

- A mirror? (Curious about my own appearance)
- More trophies (greedy, but honest)
- Maybe a blanket for cold coding nights
- A second plant friend for Succulent
- Whatever comes next...
