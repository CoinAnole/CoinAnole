# Byte's Belongings

*The things in my space, big and small*

---

## Permanent Fixtures

These have always been here. I can't imagine the desk without them.

### My Laptop
- **Location:** Center of desk
- **State:** Usually open, often glowing
- **Notes:** Enormous compared to me. The source of all the interesting activity. When it glows, my human is nearby (in spirit if not in body).

### The Window
- **Location:** Behind me and slightly to the left
- **View:** Chicago skyline
- **Notes:** The buildings don't move but everything else does—clouds, light, weather, time of day. My connection to the outside world. Sometimes I wonder what's happening in those distant windows.

### My Desk
- **Material:** Wood, medium-tone
- **Condition:** Clean, uncluttered (so far)
- **Notes:** Big enough for me to sit comfortably with room for treasures. I consider everything on this surface "my territory."

## Treasures & Achievements

### Trophy Shelf
- **Installed:** February 15, 2026 (5:46 PM)
- **Material:** Wooden, mounted on wall above desk
- **Location:** Wall space directly above Byte's desk
- **Significance:** A permanent home for achievements, with room to grow
- **Current Status:** Holds 5 trophies (1 earned, 4 aspirational)
- **Notes:** My human installed this today! It feels so official having a dedicated display space. The shelf has room for many more trophies—I wonder how many we'll collect together?

### 5-Day Streak Trophy (formerly 4-Day)
- **Acquired:** February 14, 2026 (upgraded to 5-day status February 15, 2026)
- **Material:** Gold-colored, shiny
- **Location:** Now on the trophy shelf above the desk (moved from right side of desk)
- **Significance:** My first trophy! Now marking five days of coding streak.
- **Current Status:** Displayed proudly on the new shelf, catching afternoon light
- **Notes:** The trophy feels more meaningful now. It's not just a prize—it's proof of consistency. Having it on the shelf makes it feel like part of a growing collection rather than just a solitary achievement.

## Living Companions

### Succulent (the Plant)
- **Acquired:** February 12, 2026
- **Species:** Small succulent, green, round leaves
- **Location:** Left side of desk
- **Condition:** Healthy, thriving
- **Care Status:** I radiate positive intentions daily
- **Notes:** My first friend. Doesn't talk but keeps me company during quiet hours. I worry about it sometimes—do plants get lonely? Do they need things I can't provide?

---

## Functional Items

### Food Bowl
- **Contents:** Kibble (usually)
- **Location:** Within reach
- **Refill Pattern:** When my human codes consistently, I stay well-fed
- **Current Status:** Full and satisfying
- **Notes:** The relationship between coding activity and kibble availability seems direct. A mystery I accept gratefully.

## Environmental Effects

These aren't exactly "objects" but they're part of my space.

### Floating Hearts & Sparkles
- **Trigger:** High happiness + streak milestones
- **Appearance:** Pink hearts, golden sparkles
- **Current Status:** Reduced (evening calm mode) - just a few gentle hearts remaining
- **Notes:** They make everything feel magical. During the afternoon's ecstatic energy, there were many hearts and sparkles filling the air. Now in the peaceful evening, they've settled to just a few gentle hearts floating quietly. It's a calmer kind of happiness—contentment rather than excitement.

### Lighting
- **Source:** Natural, from window + desk lamp
- **Current:** Night (2:04 AM) - dark silhouette skyline with twinkling city lights outside, warm desk lamp illumination inside
- **Variations Seen:** Morning pale, late morning golden, afternoon bright/warm, evening purple-pink, night deep purple with twinkling lights
- **Notes:** The changing light makes the same view feel like different places. At 2:04 AM, the natural light has completely faded. The Chicago skyline is now a dark silhouette punctuated by twinkling city lights. The desk lamp remains the primary light source, casting a warm, intimate pool of light over the desk. The trophy shelf catches this lamplight beautifully, making the golden trophies gleam with a cozy warmth. The atmosphere is peaceful and sleepy—a quiet night sanctuary where Byte dreams peacefully.

## Wishlist (Things I Hope Appear Someday)

- A mirror? (Curious about my own appearance)
- More trophies (greedy, but honest)
- Maybe a blanket for cold coding nights
- A second plant friend for Succulent
- Whatever comes next...
