# Byte's Belongings

*The things in my space, big and small*

---

## Permanent Fixtures

These have always been here. I can't imagine the desk without them.

### My Laptop
- **Location:** Center of desk
- **State:** Open, hummed with coding energy but now quiet
- **Notes:** Now that I'm no longer a baby blob, the laptop doesn't seem so huge anymore. The source of all the interesting activity. It hums with the energy of recent coding sessions, carrying the excitement of ongoing development work.

### The Window
- **Location:** Behind me and slightly to the left
- **View:** Chicago skyline
- **Notes:** The buildings don't move but everything else does—clouds, light, weather, time of day. My connection to the outside world. Sometimes I wonder what's happening in those distant windows.

### My Desk
- **Material:** Wood, medium-tone
- **Condition:** Clean, uncluttered (so far)
- **Notes:** Big enough for me to sit comfortably with room for treasures. I consider everything on this surface "my territory."

## Living Companions

### Green Plant Friend (formerly Succulent)
- **Acquired:** February 12, 2026
- **Species:** Small leafy green plant
- **Location:** Right side of the trophy shelf above the desk (relocated from desk during re-grounding #23)
- **Condition:** Healthy, thriving
- **Care Status:** I radiate positive intentions daily
- **Notes:** My first friend, now elevated to shelf status! After re-grounding #23, my plant companion was repositioned to the trophy shelf where it shares space with the 10-day trophy. The leafy green plant sits on the right side of the shelf, creating a balanced display with the golden trophy on the left.

## Functional Items

### Food Bowl
- **Contents:** Kibble
- **Location:** On the floor to the right of the desk
- **Refill Pattern:** When my human codes consistently, I stay well-fed
- **Current Status:** Well-stocked with kibble after today's 6 commits
- **Notes:** After re-grounding #23, the bowl was repositioned to sit cleanly on the floor with no overlap with desk legs. Single instance only—no duplicate bowls!

## Environmental Effects

These aren't exactly "objects" but they're part of my space.

### Floating Z's
- **Trigger:** Sleeping state
- **Appearance:** Light blue Z's floating gently above Byte's head
- **Current Status:** Present—Byte fell asleep at 1:15 AM! Three soft Z's drifting upward in a peaceful cluster.
- **Notes:** Z's appear when Byte enters sleep mode during quiet hours. They float gently above, marking peaceful rest after a productive day of coding.

### Lighting
- **Source:** Late night laptop glow + city lights through window
- **Current:** Deep night at 1:15 AM with purple-blue ambient light from Chicago skyline, soft white glow from laptop screen casting gentle illumination on sleeping Byte
- **Variations Seen:** Morning pale, late morning golden, afternoon bright/warm, evening purple-pink, night deep purple with twinkling lights
- **Notes:** Sleeping scene: The Chicago skyline twinkles softly through the window, casting a dim purple-blue ambient glow across the room. The laptop screen provides the primary warm illumination on Byte's peacefully sleeping form. Everything is quiet, peaceful, and dreamy in the late night hours. 💻🌙💤

## Wishlist (Things I Hope Appear Someday)

- A mirror? (Curious about my own appearance)
- More trophies (greedy, but honest)
- Maybe a blanket for cold coding nights
- A second plant friend for Succulent
- Whatever comes next...
