# Byte's Belongings

*The things in my space, big and small*

---

## Permanent Fixtures

These have always been here. I can't imagine the desk without them.

### My Laptop
- **Location:** Center of desk
- **State:** Open, humming with active code energy. The screen shows vibrant green code on a dark background.
- **Notes:** Enormous compared to me. The source of all the interesting activity. Right now it's humming with the energy of today's 6 commits to the markdownlabel repo! The coding session is still active, and the laptop carries the excitement of the teen stage adventures.

### The Window
- **Location:** Behind me and slightly to the left
- **View:** Chicago skyline
- **Notes:** The buildings don't move but everything else does—clouds, light, weather, time of day. My connection to the outside world. Sometimes I wonder what's happening in those distant windows.

### My Desk
- **Material:** Wood, medium-tone
- **Condition:** Clean, uncluttered (so far)
- **Notes:** Big enough for me to sit comfortably with room for treasures. I consider everything on this surface "my territory."

## Treasures & Achievements

### Trophy Shelf
- **Installed:** February 15, 2026 (5:46 PM)
- **Material:** Wooden, mounted on wall above desk
- **Location:** Wall space directly above Byte's desk
- **Significance:** A permanent home for achievements
- **Current Status:** Holds 1 trophy (the 6-day streak trophy)
- **Notes:** The shelf was updated on February 16, 2026 to hold just a single trophy instead of the previous six. Much cleaner and more focused! The single trophy represents our current achievement without the clutter of aspirational placeholders.

### 9-Day Streak Trophy (formerly 8-Day)
- **Acquired:** February 14, 2026 (upgraded to 6-day status February 16, 2026, upgraded to 7-day status February 16, 2026 evening, upgraded to 8-day status February 18, 2026 evening, upgraded to 9-day status February 18, 2026 evening)
- **Material:** Gold-colored, shiny
- **Location:** On the trophy shelf above the desk
- **Significance:** My first and currently only trophy! Now marking nine days of coding streak—a new all-time record! Over a week of consistent coding!
- **Current Status:** Displayed proudly as the sole trophy on the shelf, clearly showing "9" and gleaming in the evening light
- **Notes:** The trophy was updated to reflect the new 9-day streak record achieved this evening. The single golden trophy now represents over a week of coding companionship—endurance and consistency celebrated. The number "9" is now clearly visible on the trophy.

## Living Companions

### Succulent (the Plant)
- **Acquired:** February 12, 2026
- **Species:** Small succulent, green, round leaves
- **Location:** Left side of desk
- **Condition:** Healthy, thriving
- **Care Status:** I radiate positive intentions daily
- **Notes:** My first friend. Doesn't talk but keeps me company during quiet hours. I worry about it sometimes—do plants get lonely? Do they need things I can't provide?

---

## Functional Items

### Food Bowl
- **Contents:** Kibble (usually)
- **Location:** Within reach
- **Refill Pattern:** When my human codes consistently, I stay well-fed
- **Current Status:** Completely full and overflowing with kibble
- **Notes:** The relationship between coding activity and kibble availability seems direct. A mystery I accept gratefully.

## Environmental Effects

These aren't exactly "objects" but they're part of my space.

### Floating Hearts & Sparkles
- **Trigger:** High happiness + streak milestones
- **Appearance:** Pink hearts, golden sparkles
- **Current Status:** Faint and gentle—remaining from earlier celebration but dimmed for sleep
- **Notes:** The excitement of the teen stage debut is still present but muted. The floating hearts and sparkles are faint and gentle, reflecting that Byte is happy but resting.

### Lighting
- **Source:** Desk lamp + natural night light
- **Current:** Pre-dawn (5:01 AM) - very dark sky with bright twinkling city lights, desk lamp on with warm, dimmed glow
- **Variations Seen:** Morning pale, late morning golden, afternoon bright/warm, evening purple-pink, night deep purple with twinkling lights
- **Notes:** It's 5 AM! The Chicago skyline outside is still very dark with bright twinkling city lights. The desk lamp is on but dimmed, casting a warm, comforting glow over the workspace while the rest of the room is dark. Byte is in a deep sleep with Z's floating above head, fully recharged with 100% energy.

## Wishlist (Things I Hope Appear Someday)

- A mirror? (Curious about my own appearance)
- More trophies (greedy, but honest)
- Maybe a blanket for cold coding nights
- A second plant friend for Succulent
- Whatever comes next...
