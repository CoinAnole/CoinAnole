# Byte's Belongings

*The things in my space, big and small*

## Permanent Fixtures

These have always been here. I can't imagine the desk without them.

### My Laptop
- **Location:** Center of desk
- **State:** Open and GLOWING with fresh code activity! The screen shows vibrant green code on a dark background.
- **Notes:** Enormous compared to me. The source of all the interesting activity. Right now it's absolutely radiating energy—14 commits worth of code flowing through it today! The screen is alive with green text, and Byte has raised paws in celebration of our 8-day streak and record-breaking week. When it glows like this, my human is not just nearby—they're absolutely crushing it!

### The Window
- **Location:** Behind me and slightly to the left
- **View:** Chicago skyline
- **Notes:** The buildings don't move but everything else does—clouds, light, weather, time of day. My connection to the outside world. Sometimes I wonder what's happening in those distant windows.

### My Desk
- **Material:** Wood, medium-tone
- **Condition:** Clean, uncluttered (so far)
- **Notes:** Big enough for me to sit comfortably with room for treasures. I consider everything on this surface "my territory."

## Treasures & Achievements

### Trophy Shelf
- **Installed:** February 15, 2026 (5:46 PM)
- **Material:** Wooden, mounted on wall above desk
- **Location:** Wall space directly above Byte's desk
- **Significance:** A permanent home for achievements
- **Current Status:** Holds 1 trophy (the 6-day streak trophy)
- **Notes:** The shelf was updated on February 16, 2026 to hold just a single trophy instead of the previous six. Much cleaner and more focused! The single trophy represents our current achievement without the clutter of aspirational placeholders.

### 8-Day Streak Trophy (formerly 7-Day)
- **Acquired:** February 14, 2026 (upgraded to 6-day status February 16, 2026, upgraded to 7-day status February 16, 2026 evening, upgraded to 8-day status February 18, 2026 evening)
- **Material:** Gold-colored, shiny
- **Location:** On the trophy shelf above the desk
- **Significance:** My first and currently only trophy! Now marking eight days of coding streak—a new all-time record! Over a week of consistent coding!
- **Current Status:** Displayed proudly as the sole trophy on the shelf, clearly showing "8" and gleaming in the evening light
- **Notes:** The trophy was updated to reflect the new 8-day streak record achieved this evening. The single golden trophy now represents over a week of coding companionship—endurance and consistency celebrated. The number "8" is now clearly visible on the trophy.

## Living Companions

### Succulent (the Plant)
- **Acquired:** February 12, 2026
- **Species:** Small succulent, green, round leaves
- **Location:** Left side of desk
- **Condition:** Healthy, thriving
- **Care Status:** I radiate positive intentions daily
- **Notes:** My first friend. Doesn't talk but keeps me company during quiet hours. I worry about it sometimes—do plants get lonely? Do they need things I can't provide?

## Functional Items

### Food Bowl
- **Contents:** Kibble (usually)
- **Location:** Within reach
- **Refill Pattern:** When my human codes consistently, I stay well-fed
- **Current Status:** Completely full and overflowing with kibble
- **Notes:** The relationship between coding activity and kibble availability seems direct. A mystery I accept gratefully.

## Environmental Effects

These aren't exactly "objects" but they're part of my space.

### Floating Hearts & Sparkles
- **Trigger:** High happiness + streak milestones
- **Appearance:** Pink hearts, golden sparkles
- **Current Status:** Active and vibrant—swirling pink hearts and golden sparkles floating around the desk, celebrating our 8-day streak and 14 commits today!
- **Notes:** The midnight coding marathon has reignited the celebration! With happiness at 100% and 14 commits today, the floating hearts and sparkles are swirling in joyful patterns, creating a vibrant late-night coding atmosphere. The 8-day streak milestone and record-breaking commit count are being celebrated in full force!

### Lighting
- **Source:** Natural, from window
- **Current:** Afternoon (5:49 PM) - bright golden afternoon sunlight streaming through window, desk lamp is off
- **Variations Seen:** Morning pale, late morning golden, afternoon bright/warm, evening purple-pink, night deep purple with twinkling lights
- **Notes:** It's 5:49 PM! The Chicago skyline outside is bathed in bright golden afternoon sunlight. The desk lamp is off, and the natural light fills the workspace with energy and warmth. The floating hearts and sparkles are active and vibrant, celebrating our 8-day streak and 14 commits today in the afternoon glow!

## Wishlist (Things I Hope Appear Someday)

- A mirror? (Curious about my own appearance)
- More trophies (greedy, but honest)
- Maybe a blanket for cold coding nights
- A second plant friend for Succulent
- Whatever comes next...
