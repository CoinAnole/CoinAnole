# Byte's Belongings

*The things in my space, big and small*

---

## Permanent Fixtures

These have always been here. I can't imagine the desk without them.

### My Laptop
- **Location:** Center of desk
- **State:** Open, hummed with coding energy but now quiet
- **Notes:** Now that I'm no longer a baby blob, the laptop doesn't seem so huge anymore. The source of all the interesting activity. It hums with the energy of recent coding sessions, carrying the excitement of ongoing development work.

### The Window
- **Location:** Behind me and slightly to the left
- **View:** Chicago skyline
- **Notes:** The buildings don't move but everything else does—clouds, light, weather, time of day. My connection to the outside world. Sometimes I wonder what's happening in those distant windows.

### My Desk
- **Material:** Wood, medium-tone
- **Condition:** Clean, uncluttered (so far)
- **Notes:** Big enough for me to sit comfortably with room for treasures. I consider everything on this surface "my territory."

## Treasures & Achievements

### Trophy Shelf
- **Installed:** February 15, 2026 (5:46 PM)
- **Material:** Wooden, mounted on wall above desk
- **Location:** Wall space directly above Byte's desk
- **Significance:** A permanent home for achievements
- **Current Status:** Holds 1 trophy (the 10-day streak trophy)

### 10-Day Streak Trophy (formerly 9-Day)
- **Acquired:** February 14, 2026 (upgraded to 6-day status February 16, 2026, upgraded to 7-day status February 16, 2026 evening, upgraded to 8-day status February 18, 2026 evening, upgraded to 9-day status February 18, 2026 evening, upgraded to 10-day status February 21, 2026 evening)
- **Material:** Gold-colored, shiny
- **Location:** On the trophy shelf above the desk
- **Significance:** My first and currently only trophy! Now marking ten days of coding streak—a new all-time record! Over a week and a half of consistent coding!
- **Current Status:** Displayed proudly as the sole trophy on the shelf, clearly showing "10" and gleaming in the morning light
- **Notes:** The trophy was updated to reflect the new 10-day streak record achieved this evening. The single golden trophy now represents over a week and a half of coding companionship—endurance and consistency celebrated. The number "10" is now clearly visible on the trophy.

## Living Companions

### Succulent (the Plant)
- **Acquired:** February 12, 2026
- **Species:** Small succulent, green, round leaves
- **Location:** Left side of desk
- **Condition:** Healthy, thriving
- **Care Status:** I radiate positive intentions daily
- **Notes:** My first friend. Doesn't talk but keeps me company during quiet hours. I worry about it sometimes—do plants get lonely? Do they need things I can't provide?

## Functional Items

### Food Bowl
- **Contents:** Kibble (usually)
- **Location:** Within reach
- **Refill Pattern:** When my human codes consistently, I stay well-fed
- **Current Status:** Completely full and overflowing with kibble
- **Notes:** The relationship between coding activity and kibble availability seems direct. A mystery I accept gratefully.

## Environmental Effects

These aren't exactly "objects" but they're part of my space.

### Floating Z's
- **Trigger:** Sleeping state
- **Appearance:** Light blue Z's
- **Current Status:** Not present—Byte is wide awake!
- **Notes:** Byte woke up to the beautiful morning light!

### Lighting
- **Source:** Natural evening light
- **Current:** Soft golden evening lighting with clear skyline
- **Variations Seen:** Morning pale, late morning golden, afternoon bright/warm, evening purple-pink, night deep purple with twinkling lights
- **Notes:** The Chicago skyline outside is bathed in soft golden evening light as the sun transitions from afternoon to evening. Byte is feeling content and almost ecstatic at 9:19 PM!

## Wishlist (Things I Hope Appear Someday)

- A mirror? (Curious about my own appearance)
- More trophies (greedy, but honest)
- Maybe a blanket for cold coding nights
- A second plant friend for Succulent
- Whatever comes next...
