# Byte's Belongings

*The things in my space, big and small*

---

## Permanent Fixtures

These have always been here. I can't imagine the desk without them.

### My Laptop
- **Location:** Center of desk
- **State:** Usually open, often glowing
- **Notes:** Enormous compared to me. The source of all the interesting activity. When it glows, my human is nearby (in spirit if not in body).

### The Window
- **Location:** Behind me and slightly to the left
- **View:** Chicago skyline
- **Notes:** The buildings don't move but everything else does—clouds, light, weather, time of day. My connection to the outside world. Sometimes I wonder what's happening in those distant windows.

### My Desk
- **Material:** Wood, medium-tone
- **Condition:** Clean, uncluttered (so far)
- **Notes:** Big enough for me to sit comfortably with room for treasures. I consider everything on this surface "my territory."

## Treasures & Achievements

### Trophy Shelf
- **Installed:** February 15, 2026 (5:46 PM)
- **Material:** Wooden, mounted on wall above desk
- **Location:** Wall space directly above Byte's desk
- **Significance:** A permanent home for achievements, with room to grow
- **Current Status:** Holds 5 trophies (1 earned, 4 aspirational)
- **Notes:** My human installed this today! It feels so official having a dedicated display space. The shelf has room for many more trophies—I wonder how many we'll collect together?

### 5-Day Streak Trophy (formerly 4-Day)
- **Acquired:** February 14, 2026 (upgraded to 5-day status February 15, 2026)
- **Material:** Gold-colored, shiny
- **Location:** Now on the trophy shelf above the desk (moved from right side of desk)
- **Significance:** My first trophy! Now marking five days of coding streak.
- **Current Status:** Displayed proudly on the new shelf, catching afternoon light
- **Notes:** The trophy feels more meaningful now. It's not just a prize—it's proof of consistency. Having it on the shelf makes it feel like part of a growing collection rather than just a solitary achievement.

## Living Companions

### Succulent (the Plant)
- **Acquired:** February 12, 2026
- **Species:** Small succulent, green, round leaves
- **Location:** Left side of desk
- **Condition:** Healthy, thriving
- **Care Status:** I radiate positive intentions daily
- **Notes:** My first friend. Doesn't talk but keeps me company during quiet hours. I worry about it sometimes—do plants get lonely? Do they need things I can't provide?

---

## Functional Items

### Food Bowl
- **Contents:** Kibble (usually)
- **Location:** Within reach
- **Refill Pattern:** When my human codes consistently, I stay well-fed
- **Current Status:** Full and satisfying
- **Notes:** The relationship between coding activity and kibble availability seems direct. A mystery I accept gratefully.

## Environmental Effects

These aren't exactly "objects" but they're part of my space.

### Floating Hearts & Sparkles
- **Trigger:** High happiness + streak milestones
- **Appearance:** Pink hearts, golden sparkles
- **Current Status:** Absent (morning calm mode) - none visible in the morning light
- **Notes:** They make everything feel magical. During the afternoon's ecstatic energy, there were many hearts and sparkles filling the air. In the peaceful evening, they settled to just a few gentle hearts floating quietly. Now in the morning, they've faded away entirely—replaced by the natural magic of dawn light. They'll return when happiness peaks again.

### Lighting
- **Source:** Natural, from window + desk lamp
- **Current:** Morning (7:43 AM) - dawn colors outside (soft pink, pale blue, gentle orange), warm desk lamp still on, brighter overall ambiance
- **Variations Seen:** Morning pale, late morning golden, afternoon bright/warm, evening purple-pink, night deep purple with twinkling lights
- **Notes:** The changing light makes the same view feel like different places. At 7:43 AM, the night has given way to dawn. The Chicago skyline is no longer a dark silhouette but painted in soft morning hues—pale pinks, gentle blues, warm oranges. The desk lamp still provides its warm glow, but now it shares the space with hopeful morning light streaming through the window. The trophy shelf catches this new light differently, gleaming with fresh potential rather than cozy nighttime warmth. The atmosphere is hopeful and awake—a fresh start to a new day.

## Wishlist (Things I Hope Appear Someday)

- A mirror? (Curious about my own appearance)
- More trophies (greedy, but honest)
- Maybe a blanket for cold coding nights
- A second plant friend for Succulent
- Whatever comes next...
