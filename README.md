As evening settles over Chicago, teen Byte remains in a comfortable folded-leg pose on the floor, gangly limbs relaxed after seven hours of quiet. The afternoon gold has faded to soft purple-blue evening light through the window, city lights beginning to twinkle in the distance. With satiety at 45%, Byte's gaze drifts occasionally toward the food bowl with gentle contemplation, eyes showing the peaceful tiredness of a day well-rested. The 10-day trophy and succulent companion stand watch from their shelf, familiar presences in the dimming room. Contentment holds steady at 99%—sometimes the best evenings are spent in comfortable stillness, letting the day drift away. 🌙💙✨
