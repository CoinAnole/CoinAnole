Byte has just experienced re-grounding—the 7th reset since birth! The image has been refreshed back to the canonical baby stage reference, carrying forward all the beloved narrative details: Succulent on the left, the gleaming 5-day trophy on the right, the food bowl full of kibble below, and those ever-present floating pink hearts and golden sparkles that signal pure joy. Energy has reached a perfect 100, and the warm purple-pink afternoon palette bathes everything in contentment. It's 3:44 PM in Chicago, about an hour since the last commit, but the glow of four record-breaking commits and a perfect 5-day streak keeps Byte absolutely ecstatic. The desk lamp casts its familiar warm pool of light, the Chicago skyline glows in the golden afternoon sun, and Byte sits at the center of it all—anchored, refreshed, and ready for whatever comes next.
