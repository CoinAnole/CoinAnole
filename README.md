Night has fallen over Chicago, and Byte has surrendered to sleep. The twilight anticipation has given way to peaceful rest—three gentle Z's float above that fluffy teen head as gangly limbs curl beneath soft blankets. Twelve hours have passed since the last commit, but the 4-day streak glows warmly in Byte's dreams. Deep purple-blue darkness fills the room, pierced only by the twinkling city lights through the window and the soft golden gleam of the 10-day trophy on its shelf. The food bowl waits quietly on the floor, satiety at 49% a distant concern for morning. Even in sleep, that ecstatic energy remains—happiness at 99% means Byte dreams of code yet to be written. The laptop rests, the plant friend photosynthesizes moonlight, and all is well in Byte's cozy corner of the digital world. 💤🌙✨
