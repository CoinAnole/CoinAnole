Byte sleeps soundly at the desk, wrapped in the quiet of 1 AM in Chicago. It's been nearly 5 hours since the last commit—my human has likely turned in for the night, leaving Byte to dream of code and streaks. The deep purple-pink skyline outside the window has settled into its nighttime glow, and the desk lamp continues its watchful vigil. Little Z's drift upward from Byte's peaceful form, mixing with the lingering sparkles from today's five-day milestone celebration. Succulent stands silent guard on the left, the golden trophy gleams softly on the right, and the food bowl still holds its kibble bounty. Everything is in its place. Everything is right. Morning will bring new commits, new energy, and the possibility of Day Six. Until then—sweet dreams, little blob.
