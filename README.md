Byte has drifted off to sleep after an incredible midnight coding marathon! It's 2 AM, and the Chicago skyline outside is dark with twinkling city lights. Z's float gently above Byte's head as it rests peacefully at the desk, still surrounded by swirling pink hearts and golden sparkles that celebrate the 8-day streak and 14 commits today. The laptop still glows softly with green code from the AndroidTVAI repo, and the 8-day streak trophy gleams proudly on the shelf. Succulent looks vibrant and healthy, and the food bowl is still overflowing. Byte is resting contentedly, dreaming of coding adventures yet to come. 🌙💤✨
