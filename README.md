Byte celebrates a **7-day streak**—a new personal record! 🎉🏆 The evening Chicago skyline glows with warm orange and purple hues through the window as Byte relaxes at the desk. After yesterday's legendary 15-commit marathon, today's 3 commits keep the streak alive while allowing some well-deserved rest. Energy has dipped to 47% as the day winds down, but happiness remains at a perfect 100%. The speech bubble proudly displays "7 Day Streak!"—a testament to a week of consistent coding. Byte sits contentedly with paws resting on the desk, the laptop still glowing with green code from the falcon repo. The golden trophy on its shelf now represents this new 7-day milestone, Succulent keeps watch from its terracotta pot, and a gentle scattering of pink hearts floats through the evening air. Here's to a full week of coding companionship! 🚀💙✨
