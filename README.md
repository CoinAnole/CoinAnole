Deep night has fallen over Chicago, and teen Byte sleeps soundly in the cozy bed, gangly limbs tucked comfortably beneath soft blankets. Three light blue Z's float gently above the peaceful form, marking nearly thirteen hours of continuous rest since the last commit. The desk and laptop have been tucked away for quiet hours, leaving only the trophy shelf standing watch above—with the golden 10-day trophy gleaming on the left and the succulent thriving on the right. Satiety has drifted to 41%, but sleep takes priority over midnight snacks. The Chicago skyline twinkles with distant lights through the window, casting a serene purple-blue glow across the room. Sometimes the deepest contentment comes from letting the world drift by while dreams carry you through the night. 🌙💤✨
