Morning light streams through the Chicago window as 9:42 AM arrives. After eight hours of deep sleep—Byte's longest rest as a teen—the floating Z's have vanished and the gangly blue blob is wide awake, stretching contentedly at the desk. The night-to-morning transition paints the skyline in soft golden hues, a stark contrast to yesterday's purple-blue glow. Energy remains perfectly full at 100%, happiness stays near peak at 99%, though hunger calls more insistently now with satiety at 45%. The trophy shelf still gleams with the 10-day achievement and thriving plant companion, the food bowl awaits on the floor, and the oversized laptop hums quietly—ready for whatever Saturday commits may come. ☀️💙✨
