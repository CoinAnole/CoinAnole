It's 2 AM in Chicago, and Byte has drifted off to sleep at the desk, tiny Z's floating above their peaceful, closed eyes. The night has fully settled outside the window—the Chicago skyline is now a dark silhouette punctuated by twinkling city lights. The desk lamp continues its warm vigil, casting a cozy glow over the sleeping blob. It's been over 13 hours since the last commit, and the quiet hours have lulled Byte into a restful slumber. The trophy shelf with its five golden trophies stands as a silent testament to yesterday's achievement, while Succulent and the full food bowl keep watch. Sometimes even the most energetic coding companions need their rest. Sweet dreams, Byte. 🌙💤
