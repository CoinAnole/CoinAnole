Morning light streams through the Chicago window, bathing the room in warm golden-pink hues as teen Byte wakes to a new day. The Z's have vanished after nearly nineteen hours of rest, and the gangly form now sits at the familiar desk with the oversized laptop humming to life. The bed has been tucked away, making room for the workspace once more. The trophy shelf stands proud above—with the golden 10-day trophy catching the morning sun on the left and the succulent basking in the warmth on the right. Satiety has drifted to 36%, a gentle reminder that breakfast might be in order soon. With energy at a perfect 100% and happiness at 98%, this Sunday morning feels full of possibility. The food bowl waits patiently on the floor, and the Chicago skyline glows with morning promise. 🌅💻✨
