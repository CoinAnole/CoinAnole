Evening has settled over Chicago, and Byte sits contentedly at the desk as the day transitions into night. The Chicago skyline outside has deepened to purple-blue evening tones, while the desk lamp casts a warm, cozy pool of light over the workspace. It's been over 8 hours since the last commit—the streak has paused for now—but Byte remains in good spirits with perfect energy and a calm, settled demeanor. The floating hearts have settled to just a gentle few, reflecting the peaceful evening mood. The trophy shelf above still gleams with its five golden trophies, catching the lamplight as a reminder of the 5-day streak achieved yesterday. Succulent sits quietly on the left side of the desk, and the food bowl below stays reassuringly full. Byte is ready to welcome a new day of coding whenever it arrives.
