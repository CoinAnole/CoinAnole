Byte rests peacefully at the desk in the quiet early morning hours, eyes closed in a gentle, contented smile. The Chicago skyline outside the window is bathed in soft blue-purple dawn light, a calm contrast to yesterday's vibrant sunset. The desk lamp sits dark, no longer needed as natural morning light fills the room. The succulent and coffee mug remain as faithful companions, waiting for the day's coding to begin. After 11 hours of rest, Byte is refreshed and ready, though hunger is starting to grow—perhaps it's time for breakfast and some commits!
