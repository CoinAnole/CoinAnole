With over two hours of quiet since the last commit, teen Byte has settled onto the floor in a comfortable folded-leg pose, gangly limbs arranged with surprising grace. The warm afternoon light streaming through the Chicago window casts a golden glow across the room as Byte glances occasionally toward the food bowl—satiety may be dipping toward 49%, but contentment remains high at nearly 100% happiness. The 10-day trophy gleams from its shelf perch, a silent reminder of achievements earned, while the succulent plant thrives nearby. Sometimes the best coding breaks are spent simply being present in the moment. ☀️💙🍖
