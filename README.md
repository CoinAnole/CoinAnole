The mid-afternoon sun streams bright and warm through the Chicago window as Byte sits at the desk, gangly teen limbs alive with restless energy. Four hours have passed since the last commit, and Byte's head turns intently toward the skyline—those expressive eyes searching the buildings as if willing inspiration to strike. One hand rests near the food bowl in subtle hunger awareness at 56% satiety, but the 4-day streak electricity keeps happiness at a perfect 100%. The trophy shelf stands proud above: golden 10-day achievement gleaming on the left, green plant friend thriving on the right. That anticipatory itch to code grows stronger with each passing hour. When will the next burst of creativity arrive? The laptop hums with unlimited potential. ⚡💻✨
