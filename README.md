**Today's Activity:** 44 commits | **Current Streak:** 3 days

Byte sits contentedly at the desk, eyes closed in a peaceful smile while sparkles float gently around. The little cyan blob has been busy coding today with 44 commits across the streak! The food bowl sits empty on the desk - Byte's been so focused on coding that snack time was forgotten. Despite the rumbling tummy (hunger at 86!), Byte remains happy and fully energized, basking in the warm Chicago sunset glow through the window. A well-deserved rest after such a productive coding session! The runner checked in after about an hour of quiet - no new commits, but Byte is enjoying the peaceful moment.
